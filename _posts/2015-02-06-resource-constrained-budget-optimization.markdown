<h2 class="section-heading">Understanding and prioritizing your fundamental resources</h2>

<p markdown="1">As trade-off talking rational economic people, we are constantly making choices that have different costs associated with them. [^1]</p>
[^1]:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trade-off_talking_rational_economic_person">Trade-off talking rational economic person. (2013, May 22). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.</a>


<p>The three main metrics of resource expenditure against which I evaluate the cost of my decisions are, in rough order:</p>

<ol>
		<li>Financial resources</li>
		<li>Time resources </li>
		<li>Physical resources (bodily and emotional fatigue)</li>
</ol>

<p>This type of individual choice analysis can also be expressed as a simple optimization problem, as described by this reward function: </p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/utility-function.jpg" alt="Simple Utility">
<span class="caption text-muted">Where F = financial resources and W<sub>f</sub> = Weight of financial resources (how much I care about preserving them).  </span>

<p>This is a loosely formulized way of looking at the age-old discipline of budgeting.</p>

<p> The application of these principles has allowed me to maximize my utility within my resource constraints. I am not an engineer by trade and I work outside of the technology sector, so my monetary compensation is lower than many of my peers. When I personally solve for this equation, W<sub>f</sub> is weighted higher than W<sub>t</sub> and W<sub>p</sub>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Constructing your budget framework</h2>

<p>I am a budget conscious person out of necessity.  Left to their own devices, my material desires would scale infinitely upwards. If I had the appropriate wealth and income level, I'd undoubetdly be building my own personal spaceship right next to Elon.</p>

<p>However, my profitable years have thus far yielded only a linear increase in my spending power. It is therefore necessary to  realistically constrain this aspect of my life. </p>

<p> I structure my budget with a traditional 33% split: after maxing out employer-matched 401k contributions, take-home income should be divided evenly between housing, savings, and spending. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why we save</h2>

<p> Unfortunately, life is rarely so elegantly divided.  Within a budget framework, each expense must have it’s own weight. Here, I take Warren Buffett’s advice, which gives saving a strong priority over spending. This is because, simply put, saving money helps you maximize your long-term utility</p>

<p markdown="1">Saving in the present means that in the future, it is possible to make larger investments in securities, businesses, or property that will generate passive income. This is key to long-term wealth creation, and so in my own budget framework I weight saving more strongly than spending.[^2]</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Of course, we also save just so we can spend more later. I got to go on some great trips this year.  This is Lake Garda, in Northern Italy.</span>


<h2 class="section-heading">Housing in America's hottest market</h2>

<p markdown="1"> I live in San Francisco, where the median rent for new one and two bedroom apartments in the city is now the highest in the Untied States.[^3]   These rent prices are driven primarily by constrained housing supply, coupled with rapid job creation in the technology sector where median wages are high. Not working directly in the technology sector, I have to adjust my budget framework to account for these trends.</p>

<p>Searching for an apartment was an exercise in short- vs. long-term resource tradeoffs. I invested a significant amount of time and energy hunting down an apartment.  I wanted to maximize apartment quality while constrained in the following areas:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Income</li> 
 	<li>Geographic location</li>
 	<li>Aesthetic preferences</li> 
 </ol>

<p>To do this, I first had to understand the market.  I evaluated every Criagslist apartment listing in our search radius every single day for 3 months. I also checked Trulia, Zillow, RentSFNow, and canvassed our preferred neighborhoods writing down phone numbers of the "Apartment Available" signs.  As a tip, Craigslist is by far the most useful and comprehensive source for apartment rentals in San Francisco. </p>

<p>Of the apartments I researched, I visited ~15 units, and applied with my wonderful roommate to 3 of those units before signing our current lease.  By expending my short term time and physical resources, we now have a beautiful apartment that, by my estimation, is significantly below market while being in a maximally ideal location.</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">The role of housing in the reward function</h2>

<p> Including the variable cost of utilities, I currently spend ~37% of my income on housing, +4% to the ideal budget split.  Given my preference for saving over spending, I make this up by constaining my other expenses.</p>

<p>This was an acceptable tradeoff to me for several reasons. Most importantly, my apartment’s location allows me to gain in other resources some of what I trade financially. My daily commute to work is a 6 minute walk down the Filbert Steps. My apartment is also in an exceptionally beautiful part of San Francisco, which is emotionally beneficial to me. </p>

<p> If we’re looking at this in the optimization framework I proposed earlier, I’m now spending more of my financial resources to gain time and physical resources, which nets me greater utility overall.  </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Understanding your maximum spend, and optimizing within it</h2>

<p> After factoring in a 33% savings rate and ~37% housing expense, this leaves me ~30% of my income to spend in a given month.  Of this, my three main variable expense categories are food, clothing, and entertainment. </p>
	

<p>Entertainment costs are difficult to hack, because they are so much determined by social group dynamics. Concert ticket prices generally have a lower bound, as do dinners out.  Budgeting most social activities therefore becomes a simple matter of inclusion or exclusion. </p>

<p>I've personally found the most opportunity for optimization in what I spend on food and clothing. I have strong preferences for premium quality products in both of these areas, which necessitates some creative purchasing when operating within a constrained budget. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Though stringent, my budgeting has not yet led me to scavenging for food. </span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Applying the framework</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, my resource constraints are atypical for this area.  Individuals working at technology jobs in the South Bay are usually awarded higher wages to compensate for significant time lost in multi-hour daily commutes. Engineers are also compensated at higher rates to account for the scarcity of their skills and the larger number of productive hours required in programming roles.  In these cases, a personal budget framework would focus more on time optimization, while being less constrained by financial resources.</p>


<p>In it’s practical application, operating within a budget requires constant renegotiation between preferences, available resources, and constraints. Each person has unique available resource levels and varying preferences given to the tradeoffs that they make in their lives. This is a logical model that I have found useful in analyzing my own economic tradeoffs, and optimizing within my own economic reality.</p>
