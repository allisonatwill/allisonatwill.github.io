<h2 class="section heading">The human body, man. How does it work? </h2>

<p>I am obsessed with life optimization.  Every day we make hundreds of small decisions that have profound effects on our mental and physical state.  I want to get the most out of my time every day, so I run lots of experiments to maximize my energy and mental productivity. </p>

<p>The most important thing you can do to increase your energy levels is to understand that your body works as an energetic system. While plants get their energy from the sun and the dirt, us animals get our energy from the food we put in our mouths.  All of your great ideas first started out as food!</p>

<p>To maximize the energy available to your brain, you can optimize three basic systems: 1. Facilitate the flow of available nutrition around your body. 2. Increase the quantity of nutrition in your body through food choice. 3. Increase your body’s ability to process nutrition from food. </p>


<h2 class="section heading">Blood: The basic pathway </h2>

<p>Blood is the way water-soluble vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and electrolytes get where they need to go in our bodies.  This system has a pump, which is our big beautiful heart, and the better our heart works, the better this system performs.  The way to optimize blood flow is pretty simple. </p>

</ol>

<h2 class="section heading">Lymph: It's a thing </h2>

<p>The lesser-known circulatory pathway is the lymphatic system. Lymphatic fluid is the body’s waterway, and it’s how fat-soluble minerals and vitamins like A, D, E, and K travel though our bodies. It’s also how lymphocytes, the disease fighting white blood cells, get around.  Unlike blood, lymphatic fluid has no pump to move it around.  Instead, we have to move it ourselves!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever taken a yoga class, you probably felt pretty amazing afterwards.  The teacher may also have talked about “moving energy” through the body.  It’s not just a new agey idea, it’s actually a very real physical process.  By bending and stretching, we move old interstitial fluid away from our tissues and help vitamins and white blood cells reach their intended bodily destination.  </p>

<p>To get the most out of your lymph, there are two main methods of optimization: drink a lot of water, and stretch your body out.   Drink the most distilled water you can find.  Protip: get a reverse-osmosis water filter, which takes out the disinfectants that are used to treat tap water.  </p>

<p> I’ve also taken to “urban lifestyle yoga,” which is doing yoga stretches whenever you feel like it out in the wild.  You may get some strange looks, but little do those people know how great you feel from an efficient movement of lymphatic fluid! </p>

<h2 class="section heading">Micronutrition: Lego blocks of immune response </h2>

<p>The second way to increase your available energy resources is to maximize the total volume of nutrition flowing around.  Below calories and the macronutrients are micronutrients. Vitamins and minerals. These are the building blocks of new tissue.  Good micronutrition is like having a giant bucket of legos. Your body can build anything that it wants! </p>

<p>To maximize micronutrition, the best thing you can do is to eat plants. Fruits and vegetables. We are still 100% animals and not yet cyborgs, so plant food is where micronutrition is most bio-available to us.  </p>

<p>As anyone else who has tried to hack their body by eating only protein bars and multivitamins will know, taking a supplement is not the same as eating food.  The nutrition in supplement-based food like Soylent is not only less bioavailable, it’s also missing a crucial element.  We don’t just need the building blocks of micronutrition, we also need the processing agents--bacteria. </p>

<h2 class="section heading">The microbiome: We are not alone </h2>

<p>If vitamins and minerals are micronutrition, then bacteria is nanonutrition.  The human body is comprised of 10x more bacterial cells than human cells.  Don’t freak out, but you and I are living with almost 3 pounds of bacterial symbiotes inside of us, and they are known as the microbiome.</p>

<p>The microbiome is responsible for nutrient processing and energy extraction from the small intestine into the circulatory system.  It is where some of the best neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin are created. A damaged microbiome results in depression, lowered immune response, and chronic health conditions like celiac and leaky gut syndrome.  A healthy microbiome means that you can extract maximal energy out of the food you eat! </p>

<h2 class="section heading">Kombucha = life. Literally. </h2>

<p>The bacteria in our microbiome are damaged by most pesticides.  Pesticides are designed to kill bacteria!   Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is the most widely used herbicide in American farming. It's also patented as an antibiotic. That's not good for our  microbes. </p>

<p>Non-organic food decreases your energy levels over time by killing your digestive bacteria. Organic food adds to your energy levels by feeding your microbiome, which is then able to extract more energy for you to use. </p>

<p>If you aren’t ready to dedicate yourself full-force to eating only organic, you can still hack this system.  Probiotic foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and especially kombucha are all full of bacterial nanonutrition that replenish your microbiome.  Kombucha especially because it’s the tastiest :) </p>

<p>Try eating organic and drinking kombucha every day for a week, and tell me that you don’t feel absolutely amazing. For the price sensitive: It’s widely accepted that the path to material wealth is to invest money where it will generate the highest return on investment.  Investing in your food is the single best decision you can make for your brain, your happiness,  and your life. </p>

<h2 class="section heading">TL;DR Action Plan </h2>

<ul>
<br>
<li>Food is our energy source. Blood and lymph are how energy gets around the body.</li> <br>
<li>Lymph only moves when we move it.  Drink water and do some yoga stretches to get that lymph cruising around your body.</li><br>
<li>Micronutrition is what makes our bodies healthy.  It’s not effective to get it from supplements. Eat fruits and vegetables.</li><br>
<li>Bacteria are our friends!  Your microbiome is the processing plant for food energy. Pesticides kill the microbiome. Don’t kill your microbiome, feed your microbiome!</li><br>
<li>Eat organic food. Drink kombucha. Feel amazing.</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="section heading">Thanks! </h2>

<p>And there you have it!  This has been a fascinating topic for me to research, because it helped me become more dispassionate towards the role of food and exercise in my life.  I started viewing my body as a system to be optimized, and began paying attention to the feedback loop of food inputs and productivity outputs.  </p>

<p>When I understood the cycle, my daily decisions were weighed against a much more simple equation.  If it brings you energy, do it!  If it takes it away, don’t :) </p>
<p> I hope you found this informative and useful as well! </p>
